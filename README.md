- 👋 Hi, I’m @nobu0402
- ⚖️ I’m a lawyer in Japan working on legal innovation using generative AI.
- 👀 I’m interested in legal tech, RAG systems, Streamlit, Whisper, GPT API integration, and automating repetitive legal workflows.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to build AI-powered support tools for law practice. I'm not an engineer — just learning one step at a time.
- 🛠️ I’m building internal applications for legal document summarization, hearing prep, and transcript processing using OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating with developers, legal engineers, and others interested in the intersection of law and AI.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I passed four real estate-related national certifications in one year while managing my law firm full-time!
